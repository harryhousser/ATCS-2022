I played touch football with my friends at recess almost every day, and I even joined a flag football team. I would always play wide reciever and my best friend from elementary school, Evan would play quarterback. We were always on the same flag football teams, and we played together in school a lot too.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">6th grade was the first year I played on a school flag football team. Previously, whenever I played flag football it had been for a team outside of school, so I was excited to finally play for my school. I went to the Menlo middle school, and Evan was my quarterback again this year. Unfortunately, we lost to Sacred Heart this year.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">in 7th grade, I didn't make the A team (which was mostly 8th graders), but I was on Evan's team again. Unfortunately, Evan injured his elbow midway through the season, so I had to take over for quarterback. I wasn't very good at quarterback, I mostly just ran the ball but it was still fun. We lost to Sacred Heart again this year though, which sucked.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">in 8th grade, I was on the A team with all of my friends, including Evan. We now had 2 quarterbacks, Evan and Mikey. I was great friends with both of them. We beat Sacred Heart in the last second to win! On the last play of the game, they bobbled the snap and it hit the ground, so they didnt even have a chance. It was awesome.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">9th grade was covid season, and we did not play our first game until March. Usually football season is in the fall so this was a crazy year. We also only had 5 games this year due to covid, which was different as well. This was my first season playing tackle football, which was exciting despite the cirumstances. I was on Junior Varsity, and I started on defense at Strong Safety. I wasn't very good at offense and didn't play much. Evan decided to stop playing football to focus on tennis, which it turned out he was very good at. Mikey still played though. We lost to Sacred Heart this year.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">10th grade was my second year on Junior Varsity. It was really fun to be among the older people on the team, and I got a lot of playing time Offense and Defense. Mikey was our starting quarterback too, which was fun. Midway through the season, I pulled my hamstring and was out for the season. Junior Varsity lost to Sacred Heart, but Varsity won this year.</p>
