            Hi, My name is Harry Housser. I am 16 years old and am Junior in High School. I go to Menlo School in Atherton. I play football for Menlo, and my positions are Wide Reciever and Free Safety. I started playing tackle football Freshman year for Menlo and it has been my favorite sport ever since.
